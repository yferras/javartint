This is a personal project, which pursues as a goal the creation of various class libraries for developing applications that require the use of AI.

## Core

### Main concepts

*Algorithm*: is an abstraction of the concept and the basis of all the algorithms implemented in derived libraries.

*Solution*: this is the result that should return an algorithm at the end of its execution.

*Constraint*: is a condition that is imposed upon the algorithm to stop or continue its execution.

## Genetic and Evotulionary Algorithms

### Main concepts

*Gen*: is the basic unit that stores information.

*Genome*: is a biological specialization of the solution; the information represented by this solution is somehow encoded in a set of genes.

*Crossing*: is the process in which two or more genomes provide your information to be combined and get new individuals (offspring) with new features.

*Mutation*: is the process by which the information of an individual (genome) is altered to modify its features.

*Selection*: is the process by which certain individuals (genomes) are selected to fulfill any role.
